Challenge:
Write an algorithm to print the elements of a two-dimensional array 
in diagonal order, bottom-left to top-right, starting from {0,0}.  

Example:

[[1,3],[2,4]] =>

`|1 3|
|2 4|`   

=> '1 2 3 4'

Example:

[[1,3,6][2,5,8][4,7,9]] =>

|1 3 6|
|2 5 8|
|4 7 9|

=> '1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9'

The arrays are not necessarily symmetric, i.e. m x n are possible, as well as n x n.
